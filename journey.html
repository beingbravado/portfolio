            I’m not going to lie: I think I have a pretty good travel blog. (You probably do too if you’re here.) I work
            hard to
            provide excellent practical travel advice to help you travel better, but I’m not the only great travel
            blogger out
            there. In fact — and I know this might be shocking — there’s a lot about travel that I’m not an expert on.
            Family
            travel? No idea. Travel as a woman? Clueless. Information on hotels? Only a little. Photography? I can
            manage to turn my
            camera on if that counts. Food expert? Only at eating it.

            I’ve realized that it’s been a while since I last talked about the best travel blogs out there — the ones I
            read — so I
            wanted to take a moment and highlight some of my favorite travel blogs that can also help you travel better,
            cheaper,
            and smarter. There are so many good blogs out there, I feel like I’m long overdue to point you to some of
            them

        <p>“I declare this world is so beautiful that I can hardly believe it exists.” The beauty of nature can have a
            profound
            effect upon our senses, those gateways from the outer world to the inner, whether it results in disbelief in
            its very
            existence as Emerson notes, or feelings such as awe, wonder, or amazement. But what is it about nature and
            the entities
            that make it up that cause us, oftentimes unwillingly, to feel or declare that they are beautiful?</p>
        <img src="j2.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>Most often, it seems to me, we find these things to be beautiful not because of something else they might
            bring us – a
            piece of furniture, say, or a ‘delicacy’ to be consumed – but because of the way that the forms of these
            things
            immediately strike us upon observation. In fact, one might even think that this experience of beauty is one
            of the bases
            for valuing nature – nature is valuable because it is beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Emerson seems to think that beauty in the natural world is not limited to certain parts of nature to the
            exclusion of
            others. He writes that every landscape lies under “the necessity of being beautiful”, and that “beauty
            breaks in
            everywhere.” As we slowly creep out of a long winter in the Northeast, I think Emerson would find the
            lamentations about
            what we have ‘endured’ to be misguided:</p>
        <img src="j3.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>So if we’re sympathetic to the idea that nature, or aspects of it, are beautiful, we might ask ourselves why
            we
            experience nature in this way. Emerson says that nature is beautiful because it is alive, moving,
            reproductive. In
            nature we observe growth and development in living things, contrasted with the static or deteriorating state
            of the vast
            majority of that which is man-made. More generally, he writes: “We ascribe beauty to that which…has no
            superfluous
            parts; which exactly answers its end; which stands related to all things”. He cites natural structures as
            lacking
            superfluities, an observation that in general has been confirmed by the advancement of biology. Furthermore,
            he says
            that whether talking about a human artifact or a natural organism, any increase of ability to achieve its
            end or goal is
            an increase in beauty. So in Emerson we might find the resources for seeing evolution and the drive to
            survive as a
            beautiful rather than an ugly process, governed by laws that tend to increase reproductive fitness and that
            we can
            understand through observation and inquiry. And lastly, Emerson points to the relation between what we take
            to be an
            individual and the rest of nature as a quality of the beautiful. This consists in the “power to suggest
            relation to the
            whole world, and so lift the object out of a pitiful individuality.” In nature one doesn’t come across
            individuals that
            are robustly independent from their environment; rather things are intimately interconnected with their
            surroundings in
            ways that we don’t fully understand.</p>
        <img src="j4.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>In addition to the immediate experience of beauty based in perception, Emerson suggests that the beauty of
            the world may
            also be viewed as an object of the intellect. He writes that “the question of Beauty takes us out of
            surfaces, to
            thinking of the foundations of things.” In other words, we can also experience the world as beautiful
            because of its
            rational structure and our ability to grasp that structure through thought. Think for instance of the
            geometric
            structure of a crystal, or snowflake, or nautilus shell. Or consider the complexity of the fact that the
            reintroduction
            of the wolf in Yellowstone National Park changed the course of the rivers due to a chain reaction of cause
            and effect
            through the food web, a process called a trophic cascade. This reinforces Emerson’s emphasis on the
            interconnection
            between all members of the natural world; as observers of nature we are confronted with one giant, complex
            process that
            isn’t of our own making, but that we can also understand, and get a mental grasp on, even if only partially,
            and be
            awe-struck in that process of understanding.</p>
        <img src="j5.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p>There is thus an emotional or affective component in the beauty of the intellect just as there is in the
            immediate
            beauty of perception. If we destroy the natural world, we take away the things that we can marvel at and
            experience awe
            towards in these two ways. And this experience of the beautiful through the intellect may reinforce our
            attributing
            value to nature here as well, but a deeper kind of value, the intrinsic value I talked about in the last
            essay. Here it
            is not only that nature is valuable because it is beautiful, but nature is beautiful because it possesses
            intrinsic
            value, grounded in its intelligible structure. Thus we see a close parallel between goodness and beauty in
            nature. We
            can find an objective basis for goodness and beauty in nature, namely its intelligible structure, but also
            see that
            nature is valuable and beautiful for us, with the particular apparatus that nature has given us for
            navigating our way
            through the world.</p>
        <p>He should know that the landscape has beauty for his eye, because it expresses a thought which is to him
            good: and this,
            because of the same power which sees through his eyes, is seen in that spectacle</p>
