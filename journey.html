                    Emerson seems to think that beauty in the natural world is not limited to certain parts of nature to
                    the
                    exclusion of
                    others. He writes that every landscape lies under “the necessity of being beautiful”, and that
                    “beauty
                    breaks in
                    everywhere.” As we slowly creep out of a long winter in the Northeast, I think Emerson would find
                    the
                    lamentations about
